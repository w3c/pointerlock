      This specification defines an API that provides scripted access to raw
      mouse movement data while locking the target of mouse events to a single
      element and removing the cursor from view. This is an essential input

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Pointer Lock API provides applications the ability to directly
        interpret mouse movements as an input method, rather than being limited
        to only read the position of the mouse cursor. A popular example is
        that of first person movement controls in three dimensional graphics
        applications such as games: movement of the mouse is interpreted to
        control the rotation/direction of the player's camera; no mouse cursor
        is displayed, and the movement is not limited to the traditional
        boundaries (such as the user agent's window, or the overall screen)
        that the mouse cursor is usually subject to, meaning that any mouse
        movements can be tracked indefinitely in any direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pointer Lock is related to Mouse Capture [[MSDN-SETCAPTURE]]
        [[MDN-SETCAPTURE]] (Mouse Capture is unspecified: bug <a href=
        "https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14600">14600</a>).
        Capture provides continued event delivery to a target element while a
        mouse is being dragged, but ceases when the mouse button is released.
        Pointer Lock differs by being persistent, not limited by screen
        boundaries, sending events regardless of mouse button state, hiding the
        cursor, and not releasing until an API call or specific <a>default
        unlock gesture</a> by the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pointer Lock deals with capturing a single resource and relating it to
        a single element. This is similar to the Fullscreen API [[FULLSCREEN]],
        which promotes a single element to be full screen. The Pointer Lock API
        chooses to pattern the resource capture, state change, and release API
        as closely as possible after the Fullscreen API.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Pointer Lock interaction mode was previously referred to as mouse
        lock. The name was changed as many different controller types besides
        mice can manipulate the on screen pointing cursor, and they are all
        impacted.

        <dd>
          An event generated by the user agent as a result of user interaction
          processed by the user agent to interact with the page. e.g.
          <code>click</code>, but not <code>mousemove</code>.  Engagement
          gestures are defined by the events in the list of <a>activation
          triggering input event</a> with the addition of
          <code>keypress</code> and <code>keyup</code> events. Note that
          operating system level accessibility and internationalization features
          may intercept gestures before the user agent processes them for
          interaction with a page. E.g. multiple key press codes used to enter
          an extended international character.

      <h2>
        <code>pointerlockchange</code> and <code>pointerlockerror</code> Events
      </h2>
      <p>
        Two events are used to communicate pointer lock state change or an
        error in changing state. They are named <dfn>pointerlockchange</dfn>
        and <dfn>pointerlockerror</dfn>. If pointer lock is entered or exited
        for any reason a <a>pointerlockchange</a> event must be sent.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a>User agents</a> must deliver these events by <a data-lt=
        "queue a task">queuing a task</a> to <a>fire an event</a> of the
        appropriate name with its <code>bubbles</code> attribute [[DOM]] set to
        false to the pointer lock <a>target</a> element's [=Node/node
        document=].
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Magnification software increases the size of content on the screen. It
        uses the mouse to move the magnified point of focus around. When a
        pointer lock is initiated, the magnification software needs to switch
        to using the keyboard to move the magnified point of focus around
        instead. When a pointerlockchange event is fired, web browsers
        therefore need to make sure the event is communicated to assistive
        technologies like screen magnifiers.

      <p>
        The <a>Element</a> interface is extended to provide the ability to
        request the the pointer be locked.
      </p>
      <pre class="idl">
        partial interface Element {

          <p>
            Requests that the pointer be locked to a DOM element
            <dfn>target</dfn>. The <a>user agent</a> determines if pointer lock
            state will be entered and upon lock state change or error must send
            either a <a>pointerlockchange</a> or <a>pointerlockerror</a> event
            respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pointer lock must not succeed if the document object's
            [=Document/active sandboxing flag set=] has the <a>sandboxed
            pointer lock browsing context flag</a> set.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pointer lock must not succeed unless the <a>target</a>'s
            <a>shadow-including root</a> is the <a>active document</a> of a
            [=Document/browsing context=] which is (or has an <a>ancestor
            browsing context</a> which is) in focus by a window which is in
            focus by the operating system's window manager. The <a>target</a>
            element and its [=Document/browsing context=] need not be in focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a user has exited pointer lock via the <a>default unlock
            gesture</a>, or pointer lock has not previously been entered for
            this document, an event generated as a result of an <a>engagement
            gesture</a> must be received by the document before
            {{requestPointerLock()}} will succeed.
          </p>
          <aside class="note" data-link-for="Document">
            <p>
              This ensures a user can leave a document that constantly attempts
              to lock the pointer. The document will be blocked from locking
              upon initial navigation or re-acquiring lock unless the user
              re-engages directly with the document.
            </p>
            <p>
              Conversely, if pointer lock is exited via {{exitPointerLock()}}
              no <a>engagement gesture</a> is required to reenter pointer lock.
              This enables applications that frequently move between
              interaction modes, and ones that may do so based on a timer or
              remote network activity.
            </p>
            <p data-link-for="Element">
              Pointer lock is commonly combined with fullscreen [[FULLSCREEN]],
              and if an <a>engagement gesture</a> is used to enter fullscreen
              it is sufficient for a subsequent {{requestPointerLock()}}.
            </p>
          </aside>
          <p>
            If any element (including this one), whose <a>shadow-including
            root</a> is same as this element's <a>shadow-including root</a>, is
            already locked (or pending lock) the pointer lock <a>target</a>
            must be updated to this element and a <a>pointerlockchange</a>
            event sent.
          </p>
          <p>
            If any element, whose <a>shadow-including root</a> is a different
            document, is already locked the request must fail and a
            <a>pointerlockerror</a> event be sent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once in the locked state the <a>user agent</a> must fire all
            relevant user generated {{MouseEvent}} events (for example:
            `mousemove`, `mousedown`, `mouseup`, `click`, and `wheel`)
            [[ui-events]] to the <a>target</a> of pointer lock, and not fire
            mouse events to other elements. Events that require the concept of
            a mouse cursor must not be dispatched (for example: `mouseover`,
            `mouseout`, `drag`, and `drop`).
          </p>
          <p>
            In the locked state the system mouse cursor must be hidden.
            Movement and button presses of the mouse must not cause the window
            to lose focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Synthetic mouse events created by application script act the same
            regardless of lock state.

            When unlocked, the system cursor can exit and re-enter the <a>user
            agent</a> window. If it does so and the <a>user agent</a> was not
            the target of operating system mouse move events then the most
            recent pointer position will be unknown to the <a>user agent</a>
            and {{movementX}}/{{movementY}} can not be computed and must be set
            to zero.
          </p>
          <p>
            When pointer lock is enabled <code>clientX</code>,
            <code>clientY</code>, <code>screenX</code>, and
            <code>screenY</code> must hold constant values as if the pointer
            did not move at all once pointer lock was entered. But
            {{movementX}}/{{movementY}} must continue to provide the change in
            position of the pointer as when the pointer is unlocked. There will
            be no limit to {{movementX}}/{{movementY}} values if the mouse is
            continuously moved in a single direction. The concept of the mouse
            cursor will have been removed, and it will not move off the window
            or be clamped by a screen edge.
          </p>
          <p>
            The un-initialized value of {{movementX}}/{{movementY}} must be
            <code>0</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Large movement values must not appear in situations when mouse
            input is interupted, such as the mouse cursor leaving the window
            and then re-entering at another location. If a <a>User agent</a>
            experiences a gap in receiving mouse input data from the operating
            system then the next generated <code>mousemove</code> event must
            have {{movementX}}/{{movementY}} set to <code>0</code>. These gaps
            may appear for example when the <a>User agent</a> receives a mouse
            leaving event at the window system API. As an exception mouse
            capture may allow the <a>User agent</a> to continue receiving mouse
            events when the cursor moves outside the window.

          A player on a first/third person game will need to control the
          view-port orientation. A widely used method is the use of mouse
          movements to control the viewing angle. This kind of application can
          use the Pointer Lock API to allow a complete freedom of control over
          the viewport's yaw and pitch even when the user is not pressing mouse
          buttons. Those buttons can be used for other actions while constantly
          providing navigation via mouse movement.

          Users of a three dimensional modeling application will need to rotate
          models. A application can use the Pointer Lock API to enable the
          author to rotate the model freely in a drag operation without
          limiting motion. Without pointer lock a drag would stop providing
          motion data when the mouse cursor is limited by the edge of the
          screen.

        <p>
          Similarly, absolute motion panning of a large two dimensional image

          Synthetic cursor interaction with HTML DOM UI
        </h2>
        <p>
          Some games use a classical cursor, however they want it to be limited
          or controlled in some manner. E.g. limited to the bounds of the game,
          or movable by the game. Locking the pointer enables this if the
          application creates their own cursor. However HTML and DOM should
          still be available to use for user interface. Synthetic mouse events
          should be permitted to allow an application defined cursor to
          interact with DOM. E.g. the following code should permit a custom
          cursor to send click events while the pointer is locked:
        </p>
        <pre class='example' id="example-synthetic-cursor">
            document.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
              if (e._isSynthetic)
                return;
              // send a synthetic click
              var ee = document.createEvent("MouseEvents");
              ee._isSynthetic = true;
              x = myCursor.x;
              y = myCursor.y;
              ee.initMouseEvent("click", true, true, null, 1,
                                x + e.screenX - e.clientX,
                                y + e.screenY - e.clientY,
                                x,
                                y);
              var target = document.elementFromPoint(x, y);
              if (target)
                target.dispatchEvent(ee);
            });
        </pre>
        <p>
          Note that synthetic clicks may not be permitted by a <a>user
          agent</a> to produce the same default action as a non-synthetic
          click. However, application handlers can still take action and
          provide user interface with existing HTML & DOM mechanisms.

        <p>
          Real Time Strategy games often use this technique. When the player
          moves the pointer to the view-port borders, if they "push" the border
          with a mouse movement, the view-port is panned over the game area
          according to how much they move the mouse. When moving the mouse
          cursor within the bounds of the view port it acts at is typically
          would on a system. Applications may choose to implement this using
          pointer lock and the previous use case of "Synthetic cursor
          interaction with HTML DOM UI" to bring cursor behavior completely

        <h2>
          Why not merge with Mouse Capture: setCapture()?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Mouse Capture [[MDN-SETCAPTURE]] handles low security risk mouse
          event target lock for the duration of a mouse drag gesture. Pointer
          lock removes the concept of the cursor and directs all events to a
          given target. They are related, but different.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a browser implemented both, it would be reasonable to support a
          combination of traits: The security simplicity of "automatically
          release lock when mouse up" and the increased functionality of total
          control over mouse input and removal of the system cursor. The
          security trait would allow more permissive use of the feature for
          applications that only required a short burst of pointer lock during
          a drag event.
        </p>
        <p>
          This functionality is omitted from the initial version of this spec
          because it helps the minor use cases in windowed mode but we still do
          not have an implementation solving the major ones. And, to implement
          this a browser must implement both, which none does yet. It is not
          clear if this feature should live on .lock or on .setCapture. If both
          were implemented, either API could be augmented fairly easily to
          offer the hybrid functionality.

          Why bundle all functionality (hiding cursor, providing mouse deltas)
          instead of using CSS to hide the cursor, always providing delta
          values, and offering an API to restrict the cursor movement to a
          portion of the web page?
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are good motivations to provide a more fine grained approach.
          E.g. the use case "View-port panning by moving a mouse cursor against
          the bounds of a view-port" doesn't require hiding the mouse cursor,
          only bounding it and always having delta values available. Also, this
          specification defines the movement deltas to be taken from how the
          system mouse cursor moves, which incorporates operating system
          filtering and acceleration of the mouse movement data. Applications
          may desire access to a more raw form of movement data prior to
          adjustments appropriate for a mouse cursor. Also, raw data may
          provide better than pixel level accuracy for movement, as well as
          higher frequency updates. Providing the raw delta movement would also
          not require special permission or mode from a user, and for some set
          of applications that do not require bounding the cursor may reduce
          the security barriers and prompts needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two justifications for postponing this finer grained
          approach. The first is a concern of specifying what units mouse
          movement data are provided in. This specification defines
          .movementX/Y precisely as the same values that could be recorded when
          the mouse is not under lock by changes in .screenX/Y. Implementations
          across multiple <a>user agents</a> and operating systems will easily
          be able to meet that requirement and provide application developers
          and users with a consistent experience. Further, users are expected
          to have already configured the full system of hardware input and
          operating system options resulting in a comfortable control the
          system mouse cursor. By specifying .movementX/Y in the same units
          mouse lock API applications will be instantly usable to all users
          because they have already settled their preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, the implementation of providing movement data and bounding
          the mouse cursor is more difficult in the fine grained approach.
          Bundling the features together gives implementations freedom to use a
          variety of techniques as appropriate on each operating system and is
          more practical to implement. Direct APIs do not exist on major
          desktop platforms (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux) to bound the cursor to a
          specific rectangle, and prototypes have not yet been developed to
          demonstrate building that behavior by e.g. <a href=
          "https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/window/attributes/">invisible
          windows</a> with <a href=
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xlib">Xlib</a> or manual cursor
          movement on Mac. Unaccelerated Delta values have been proposed to be
          accessed by reading raw Human Interface Device (HID) data. E.g.
          WM_INPUT messages on Windows, and USB device APIs on Mac OS X /
          Linux. The challenge here is interpreting and normalizing the units
          to some consistent and specifiable scale. Also, most APIs considered
          to date are limited to USB devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be reasonable to consider adding these capabilities in the
          future, as the currently specified pointer lock API would be easy to
          continue to support if the finer grained delta and confinement
          features were implemented.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bundled API is selected for implementation practicality, because
          the desired use cases are supported, and because it will not conflict
          with future improvements as discussed here.

          "#why-bundle">"Why bundle all functionality (hiding cursor, providing
          mouse deltas) instead of using CSS to hide the cursor, always
          providing delta values, and offering an API to restrict the cursor
          movement to a portion of the web page?"</a>.

        <h2>
          Why modify MouseEvent and reuse existing mouse events instead of
          creating a mouse delta event?
        </h2>
        <p>
          When under pointer lock many mouse events remain relevant, e.g.
          click, mousedown, etc. These all share the same event data structure
          MouseEvent. If movement data were reported via a new data structure
          then a new event would be needed for reporting delta movement. The
          new data structure would have many parallels to MouseEvent to offer
          the same conveniences, e.g. button and modifier key states. When
          handling click, down, and up events would the existing mousedown,
          mouseup be used? If so, they would provide .clientX/Y and .screenX/Y
          with no useful data, but would lack the convenience of containing the
          current movement data. Or, new events would also be required for when
          the mouse is locked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, movementX/Y are convenient even when the mouse is not locked.
          This spec requires movement members to always be valid, even when the
          mouse cursor exists. This reduces code required to track the last
          cursor state and mouseover/mouseout transitions if applications wish
          to make use of delta motion of the mouse.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only negative of adding movementX/Y to MouseEvent appears to be
          the unused values in clientX/Y and screenX/Y when under pointer lock.
          This does not seem to be a significant problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the minimal change to add movementX/Y to MouseEvent is
          selected to reduce API and implementation complexity.

        <h2>
          Why separate targets for mouse events under pointer lock and keyboard
          input focus?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Consider a game with a 3D view controlled by moving the mouse cursor,
          while the user may still chat with other users via a text console. It
          is reasonable for the application to accept text input to an element
          that is different than where mouse events are being dispatched. This
          is similar to pre-existing behavior of receiving mousemove events
          over any element while typing into a form on a page.
