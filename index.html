      This specification defines an API that provides scripted access to raw
      mouse movement data while locking the target of mouse events to a single
      element and removing the cursor from view. This is an essential input

        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Pointer Lock API provides applications the ability to directly
        interpret mouse movements as an input method, rather than being limited
        to only read the position of the mouse cursor. A popular example is
        that of first person movement controls in three dimensional graphics
        applications such as games: movement of the mouse is interpreted to
        control the rotation/direction of the player's camera; no mouse cursor
        is displayed, and the movement is not limited to the traditional
        boundaries (such as the user agent's window, or the overall screen)
        that the mouse cursor is usually subject to, meaning that any mouse
        movements can be tracked indefinitely in any direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pointer Lock is related to Mouse Capture [[MDN-SETCAPTURE]] (Mouse
        Capture is unspecified: bug <a href=
        "https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14600">14600</a>).
        Capture provides continued event delivery to a target element while a
        mouse is being dragged, but ceases when the mouse button is released.
        Pointer Lock differs by being persistent, not limited by screen
        boundaries, sending events regardless of mouse button state, hiding the
        cursor, and not releasing until an API call or specific <a>default
        unlock gesture</a> by the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pointer Lock deals with capturing a single resource and relating it to
        a single element. This is similar to the Fullscreen API [[FULLSCREEN]],
        which promotes a single element to be full screen. The Pointer Lock API
        chooses to pattern the resource capture, state change, and release API
        as closely as possible after the Fullscreen API.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Pointer Lock interaction mode was previously referred to as mouse
        lock. The name was changed as many different controller types besides
        mice can manipulate the on screen pointing cursor, and they are all
        impacted.

        <h3>
          The <dfn>pointer lock state</dfn> definition
        </h3>
        <p>
          The [=pointer lock state=] is the state where a single DOM element,
          which we will call the <dfn>pointer-lock target</dfn>, receives all
          mouse events and the cursor is hidden.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once in the [=pointer lock state=] the [=user agent=] has a
          [=pointer-lock target=], a <dfn>pointer-lock options</dfn>, which is
          a {{PointerLockOptions}} and a <dfn>cursor position</dfn> which is a
          pair of numbers representing the location of the system mouse cursor
          when the Pointer Lock State was entered (the same location that is
          reported in `screenX`, `screenY`). The [=pointer-lock target=]
          receives all relevant user generated {{MouseEvent}} events: namely,
          all user-generated `mousemove`, `mousedown`, `mouseup`, `click`,
          `dblclick`, `auxclick`, and `wheel` [[ui-events]]. No other elements
          receive these events while in [=pointer lock state=]. There will be
          no dispatching of events that require the concept of a mouse cursor:
          namely, `mouseenter`, `mouseleave`, `mouseover`, `mouseout`, `drag`,
          and `drop`.
        </p>
        <p>
          While in the [=pointer lock state=] if the [=pointer-lock options=]'
          {{PointerLockOptions/unadjustedMovement}} member is `true`, the event
          coordinates will not be affected by the underlying platform
          behaviors such as mouse acceleration. In other words, the user agent
          uses the APIs provided by the underlying platform to guarantee
          getting the raw events. If the {{PointerLockOptions}}'
          {{PointerLockOptions/unadjustedMovement}} member is `false`, the user
          agent relies on the default behavior of the underlying platform
          regarding the mouse acceleration.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the [=pointer lock state=], the system mouse cursor is hidden and
          the window is prevented from losing focus, regardless of mouse
          movement or button presses. This is directly or indirectly achieved
          utilizing the underlying operating system API.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Synthetic mouse events created by application script act the same
          regardless of lock state.

          `pointerlockchange` and `pointerlockerror` Events
        </h3>
        <p>
          Two events are used to communicate pointer lock state change or an
          error in changing state. They are named <dfn class=
          "event">pointerlockchange</dfn> and <dfn class=
          "event">pointerlockerror</dfn>. Refer
          to algorithm of [[[#requestPointerLock]]] for detail.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Magnification software increases the size of content on the screen.
          It uses the mouse to move the magnified point of focus around. When a
          pointer lock is initiated, the magnification software needs to switch
          to using the keyboard to move the magnified point of focus around
          instead. When a {{pointerlockchange}} event is fired, web browsers
          therefore need to make sure the event is communicated to assistive
          technologies like screen magnifiers.

            {{movementX}} and {{movementY}} must be zero for all mouse events
            except `mousemove`. All motion data must be delivered via
            `mousemove` events such that between any two mouse events
            `earlierEvent` and `currentEvent` the value of
            `currentEvent.screenX - earlierEvent.screenX` is equivalent to the
            sum of all {{movementX}} in the events after `earlierEvent`, with

            {{movementX}} and {{movementY}} must be updated regardless of

          <p>
            When unlocked, the system cursor can exit and re-enter the [=user

            target of operating system mouse move events then the most recent
            pointer position will be unknown to the [=user agent=] and
            {{movementX}} / {{movementY}} can not be computed and must be set

          <p>
            When pointer lock is enabled `clientX`, `clientY`, `screenX`, and

            at all once pointer lock was entered. But {{movementX}} and
            {{movementY}} must continue to provide the change in position of
            the pointer as when the pointer is unlocked. There will be no limit
            to {{movementX}} and {{movementY}} values if the mouse is
            continuously moved in a single direction. The concept of the mouse
            cursor will have been removed, and it will not move off the window
            or be clamped by a screen edge.

            The un-initialized value of {{movementX}} and {{movementY}} must be

          <p>
            Large movement values must not appear in situations when mouse
            input is interupted, such as the mouse cursor leaving the window
            and then re-entering at another location. If a [=user agent=]
            experiences a gap in receiving mouse input data from the operating
            system then the next generated `mousemove` event must have
            {{movementX}} and {{movementY}} set to `0`. These gaps may appear
            for example when the [=user agent=] receives a mouse leaving event
            at the window system API. As an exception mouse capture may allow
            the [=user agent=] to continue receiving mouse events when the

        <p>
          A player on a first/third person game will need to control the
          view-port orientation. A widely used method is the use of mouse
          movements to control the viewing angle. This kind of application can
          use the Pointer Lock API to allow a complete freedom of control over
          the viewport's yaw and pitch even when the user is not pressing mouse
          buttons. Those buttons can be used for other actions while constantly
          providing navigation via mouse movement.

        <p>
          Users of a three dimensional modeling application will need to rotate
          models. A application can use the Pointer Lock API to enable the
          author to rotate the model freely in a drag operation without
          limiting motion. Without pointer lock a drag would stop providing
          motion data when the mouse cursor is limited by the edge of the
          screen.

        <p>
          Similarly, absolute motion panning of a large two dimensional image

        <p>
          When modifying numerically magnitudes in applications sometimes the

          increment or decrement the numeric value. E.g. a spinner with a
          number entry text box and arrows pointing up and down that can be
          clicked or dragged on to change the value. An application could use
          the Pointer Lock API to allow modifying the numeric values beyond
          what the logical screen bounds allow. The same could apply for a
          control that fast forwards or rewinds a video or audio stream like a
          "jog".

          Synthetic cursor interaction with HTML DOM UI

        <p>
          Some games use a classical cursor, however they want it to be limited
          or controlled in some manner. E.g. limited to the bounds of the game,
          or movable by the game. Locking the pointer enables this if the
          application creates their own cursor. However HTML and DOM should
          still be available to use for user interface. Synthetic mouse events
          should be permitted to allow an application defined cursor to
          interact with DOM. E.g. the following code should permit a custom
          cursor to send click events while the pointer is locked:
        </p>
        <pre class='example'>
            document.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
              if (e._isSynthetic)
                return;
              // send a synthetic click
              var ee = document.createEvent("MouseEvents");
              ee._isSynthetic = true;
              x = myCursor.x;
              y = myCursor.y;
              ee.initMouseEvent("click", true, true, null, 1,
                                x + e.screenX - e.clientX,
                                y + e.screenY - e.clientY,
                                x,
                                y);
              var target = document.elementFromPoint(x, y);
              if (target)
                target.dispatchEvent(ee);
            });
        </pre>
        <p>
          Note that synthetic clicks may not be permitted by a [=user agent=]
          to produce the same default action as a non-synthetic click. However,
          application handlers can still take action and provide user interface
          with existing HTML & DOM mechanisms.

          View-port panning by moving a mouse cursor against the bounds of a

        </h2>
        <p>
          Real Time Strategy games often use this technique. When the player
          moves the pointer to the view-port borders, if they "push" the border
          with a mouse movement, the view-port is panned over the game area
          according to how much they move the mouse. When moving the mouse
          cursor within the bounds of the view port it acts at is typically
          would on a system. Applications may choose to implement this using
          pointer lock and the previous use case of "Synthetic cursor
          interaction with HTML DOM UI" to bring cursor behavior completely
          under their control.

        <h2>
          Why not merge with Mouse Capture: setCapture()?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Mouse Capture [[MDN-SETCAPTURE]] handles low security risk mouse
          event target lock for the duration of a mouse drag gesture. Pointer
          lock removes the concept of the cursor and directs all events to a
          given target. They are related, but different.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a browser implemented both, it would be reasonable to support a
          combination of traits: The security simplicity of "automatically
          release lock when mouse up" and the increased functionality of total
          control over mouse input and removal of the system cursor. The
          security trait would allow more permissive use of the feature for
          applications that only required a short burst of pointer lock during
          a drag event.
        </p>
        <p>
          This functionality is omitted from the initial version of this spec
          because it helps the minor use cases in windowed mode but we still do
          not have an implementation solving the major ones. And, to implement
          this a browser must implement both, which none does yet. It is not
          clear if this feature should live on .lock or on .setCapture. If both
          were implemented, either API could be augmented fairly easily to
          offer the hybrid functionality.

          Why bundle all functionality (hiding cursor, providing mouse deltas)
          instead of using CSS to hide the cursor, always providing delta
          values, and offering an API to restrict the cursor movement to a
          portion of the web page?
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are good motivations to provide a more fine grained approach.
          E.g. the use case "View-port panning by moving a mouse cursor against
          the bounds of a view-port" doesn't require hiding the mouse cursor,
          only bounding it and always having delta values available. Also, this
          specification defines the movement deltas to be taken from how the
          system mouse cursor moves, which incorporates operating system
          filtering and acceleration of the mouse movement data. Applications
          may desire access to a more raw form of movement data prior to
          adjustments appropriate for a mouse cursor. Also, raw data may
          provide better than pixel level accuracy for movement, as well as
          higher frequency updates. Providing the raw delta movement would also
          not require special permission or mode from a user, and for some set
          of applications that do not require bounding the cursor may reduce
          the security barriers and prompts needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two justifications for postponing this finer grained
          approach. The first is a concern of specifying what units mouse
          movement data are provided in. This specification defines
          .movementX/Y precisely as the same values that could be recorded when
          the mouse is not under lock by changes in .screenX/Y. Implementations
          across multiple [=user agents=] and operating systems will easily be
          able to meet that requirement and provide application developers and
          users with a consistent experience. Further, users are expected to
          have already configured the full system of hardware input and
          operating system options resulting in a comfortable control the
          system mouse cursor. By specifying .movementX/Y in the same units
          mouse lock API applications will be instantly usable to all users
          because they have already settled their preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, the implementation of providing movement data and bounding
          the mouse cursor is more difficult in the fine grained approach.
          Bundling the features together gives implementations freedom to use a
          variety of techniques as appropriate on each operating system and is
          more practical to implement. Direct APIs do not exist on major
          desktop platforms (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux) to bound the cursor to a
          specific rectangle, and prototypes have not yet been developed to
          demonstrate building that behavior by e.g. <a href=
          "https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/window/attributes/">invisible
          windows</a> with <a href=
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xlib">Xlib</a> or manual cursor
          movement on Mac. Unaccelerated Delta values have been proposed to be
          accessed by reading raw Human Interface Device (HID) data. E.g.
          WM_INPUT messages on Windows, and USB device APIs on Mac OS X /
          Linux. The challenge here is interpreting and normalizing the units
          to some consistent and specifiable scale. Also, most APIs considered
          to date are limited to USB devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be reasonable to consider adding these capabilities in the
          future, as the currently specified pointer lock API would be easy to
          continue to support if the finer grained delta and confinement
          features were implemented.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bundled API is selected for implementation practicality, because
          the desired use cases are supported, and because it will not conflict
          with future improvements as discussed here.

        <h2>
          Why modify MouseEvent and reuse existing mouse events instead of
          creating a mouse delta event?
        </h2>
        <p>
          When under pointer lock many mouse events remain relevant, e.g.
          click, mousedown, etc. These all share the same event data structure
          MouseEvent. If movement data were reported via a new data structure
          then a new event would be needed for reporting delta movement. The
          new data structure would have many parallels to MouseEvent to offer
          the same conveniences, e.g. button and modifier key states. When
          handling click, down, and up events would the existing mousedown,
          mouseup be used? If so, they would provide .clientX/Y and .screenX/Y
          with no useful data, but would lack the convenience of containing the
          current movement data. Or, new events would also be required for when
          the mouse is locked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, movementX/Y are convenient even when the mouse is not locked.
          This spec requires movement members to always be valid, even when the
          mouse cursor exists. This reduces code required to track the last
          cursor state and mouseover/mouseout transitions if applications wish
          to make use of delta motion of the mouse.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only negative of adding movementX/Y to MouseEvent appears to be
          the unused values in clientX/Y and screenX/Y when under pointer lock.
          This does not seem to be a significant problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the minimal change to add movementX/Y to MouseEvent is
          selected to reduce API and implementation complexity.

        <h2>
          Why separate targets for mouse events under pointer lock and keyboard
          input focus?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Consider a game with a 3D view controlled by moving the mouse cursor,
          while the user may still chat with other users via a text console. It
          is reasonable for the application to accept text input to an element
          that is different than where mouse events are being dispatched. This
          is similar to pre-existing behavior of receiving mousemove events
          over any element while typing into a form on a page.
